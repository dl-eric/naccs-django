      <div class="body transparent">
        <div class="body_content">
          Participating collegiate team(s) must fall under ALL of the following criteria(s) to be eligible to compete in North American Collegiate Counter-Strike’s League:

          <ul>
            <li>All collegiate teams must have a minimum of 5 collegiate players who all attend the same college or university</li>
            <li>And each team must represent their respective college or university.</li>
          </ul>

          Collegiate player(s) can only compete for one collegiate team at a time - Division 1 or Division 2.
          <br><br>
          <u>Exceptions</u>
          <br>
          <p>Any college or university that is unable to furnish five players to create a collegiate team will be allowed to seek other collegiate player(s) in the same predicament within their state (US) or province (CA). Closer proximity colleges or universities from one another in the same predicament will be forcibly prioritized by NACCS over colleges or universities that are of farther proximity from one another. For example, if Mt. San Antonio College is only able to furnish three collegiate players from their respective school and the next closest college in the same predicament is Rio Hondo College with two collegiate players, then those two colleges will be forced to create a collegiate team with one another if they want to compete in North American Collegiate Counter-Strike’s League.</p>

          <p>Any team that attempts in any way, shape, or form to exploit this exception will receive a 2 year minimum suspension. Exploitations include the following, but not limited to: choosing a farther proximity college or university over a closer proximity college or university; having five collegiate players at their respective college or university that are able to compete but deciding to only use three of the collegiate players with the intent of discarding the other two collegiate players due to being of a lesser skill level in order to pick up two better collegiate players from another college or university by exploiting this exception.</p>

          <u>Division 1 Team Eligibility</u>
          <p>An accredited college or university may only field one Division 1 team at a time. The maximum allotted roster size will be 10 players.</p>

          <u>Division 2 Team Elgibility</u>
          <p>An accredited college or university may field an unlimited number of Division 2 teams. The maximum allotted roster size will be 10 players.</p>

          <p>Any collegiate team that attempts in any way, shape, or form to exploit Division 2 by doing any of the following actions will receive a 2 year minimum suspension. These exploitations include the following, but not limited to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Using a Division 1 team to compete in Division 2 despite having the option to compete in Division 1</li>
            <li>Using Division 1 level players to compete in Division 2 despite having the opportunity to compete in Division 1</li>
            <li>And any other smurfing exploitation not mentioned in this rulebook.</li>
          </ol>

          <u>Division Exceptions</u>
          <p>If a college or university has only 1 collegiate team then that collegiate team will be forced to play Division 1; however, if the collegiate team believes that competing in Division 1 is significantly out of their team’s skill threshold, then an exception to compete in Division 2 may be made upon approval from NACCS. If a team believes this exception may apply to them, then please reach out to a NACCS admin or staff member for further approval.</p>
          <p>Collegiate team roster(s) will automatically lock at the start of playoffs.</p>

          <u>Roster Changes</u>
          <p>Division 1 player(s) may only be demoted to their respective college or university Division 2 team at any time upon approval from North American Collegiate Counter-Strike. Division 2 player(s) may promote to their respective college or university Division 1 team at any time without approval from North American Collegiate Counter-Strike.</p>
          <p>Collegiate player(s) that are not currently competing on a Division 1 or Division 2 team can be added to a Division 1 or Division 2 team roster at any time during the collegiate season (excluding playoffs).</p>
          <p>During playoffs, roster changes will only be permitted upon meeting the following: 1) unforeseen extenuating circumstances; and 2) approval from NACCS.</p>

          <u>Team Names</u>
          <p>Participating collegiate team(s) must use one of the following team name format(s) to be eligible to compete in North American Collegiate Counter-Strike’s League:</p>

        <div class="body_content">
          <p>Collegiate team captains are held entirely responsible for scheduling their team(s) collegiate matches. </p>

          <p>The Default Match Time will be Sunday at 4 P.M. Central Standard Time. If one team is unable to play at the designated Default Match Time then both teams are REQUIRED to communicate with one another to reschedule the match BEFORE the next designated Default Match Time. If both teams are unable to agree upon a rescheduled match time, then BOTH teams are required to IMMEDIATELY reach out to a NACCS admin or staff member. Failure to do so may result in a forfeit loss (FFL) for one or both teams.</p>
          <p>Failure to accommodate a time that works for both collegiate teams will result in the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>NACCS will request a thoroughly filled out 1-week team availability sheet from both teams. Failure to provide a thoroughly filled out team availability sheet within 12 hours upon request will result in a forfeit loss (FFL); therefore, giving the opposing team the forfeit win (FFW).</li>
            <li>NACCS will then look at both collegiate teams 1-week availability sheets to determine a designated rescheduled match time that feasibly works for both teams.</li>
            <li>If NACCS is unable to find a feasible match time for possible collegiate teams based off the submitted 1-week availability sheets, then the team with the most least availability will receive a forfeit loss (FFL);therefore, the team with the most availability will receive a forfeit win (FFW). </li>
          </ol>

          <u>Rescheduling</u>
          <p>All rescheduling will be done on the designated league match page. Once both teams agree upon a rescheduled time and date for their particular match, simply have one of the collegiate teams offer a time in the designated FACEIT match page while the other team accepts it. Here at NACCS we take pride in having a professional platform provide designated match pages for all North American Collegiate Counter-Strike’s League matches.</p>
          <p>Both teams are required to choose whichever server results in the most similar average ping between both teams. For example, Team A has 55 average ping and Team B has 53 average ping on X server.</p>

          <u>In-game assistance</u>
          <p>Jump-throw binds are permitted. Cheating is not. Don't cheat.</p>

          <u>Match Check-In</u>
          <p>The map and server veto process starts immediately at the designated match time. Each team will have 60 seconds to ban and/or pick when it is their turn to do so. Once the map and server are decided, a play button and IP notification will appear on the designated match page. Each team will then have 10 minutes to join the match server.</p>
          <p>During warm-up, both captains will have to type “!ready” to start the match. Each team will have a total of 10 minutes to use this command or else the match will result in a forfeit loss for the team who failed to ready up. A team may start the match with only 4 players in the match server.</p>
          <p>Once both teams ready up, the match will immediately go into the knife round to choose sides. Upon completion of the knife round, the winning team’s captain will need to pick a side by using the following commands: “!stay” or “!switch.” If the winning team’s captain fails to select a side within 1 minute of winning the knife round, then the sides will be randomly decided by the server.</p>

          <u>Forfeit Guidelines</u>
          <p>Each team will have a 15 minute grace period after the designated match time to have at least 4 players in the designated match server. If a team fails to furnish at least 4 players in the designated match server by the end of the 15 minute grace period, then the team that failed to furnish at least 4 players in the designated match server will automatically forfeit their match. Forfeit(s) will count as a 1-0 (16-0) victory for the opposing team.</p>
          <p>To receive a forfeit win, simply wait in the designated match server with 5 players from your team until the 15 minute grace period has passed. Once the 15 minute grace period has past, FACEIT’s automated server system will notify in the server’s general chat once the forfeit win has successfully gone through. Please do not leave the server until you receive this message in the server’s general chat.</p>
          <p>Team are allowed to forfeit a match at any given time throughout the season. If a team forfeits a match, the opposing team will receive a 1-0 (16-0) victory for the match. The team receiving the forfeit win can do one of the following to receive the forfeit win: message a NACCS admin or staff member with some form of documentation (chat logs, screenshots, etc.) showing written confirmation of the forfeit from the forfeiting team; or join the designated match server and wait 15 minutes after the allotted match time to automatically receive the forfeit win. If a NACCS staff member does not give confirmation of the forfeit win, then report to the match at the designated match time to receive the forfeit win. </p>

          <u>How to Join Match Server</u>
          <p>Once both teams have finished the map and server veto process, a play button and IP notification will appear on the designated match page. For a player to join the designated match server, simply click on the “PLAY” button or copy the “connect serverip” (provided on the match page) command and paste it into your CS:GO console. This will connect you to the designated match server.</p>

          <u>Team Pause Guidelines</u>
          <p>Each team is allowed four tactical pauses for 30 seconds each. Simply call for a tactical pause by pressing the “esc” key then clicking “call tactical timeout.” Upon doing so, your team will need to vote “yes” to initiate the tactical pause.</p>

          <p>Each team is allowed unlimited technical pauses up to 5 minutes each. Simply type “!pause” in chat followed by the reason for the technical pause in general chat to notify the other team of the technical pause. However, if a team is unable to resolve their technical issue after 5 minutes, then the other team is allowed to unpause the match after notifying the pausing team that their time is up. Simply type “!unpause” in general chat to resume the match. NACCS requires that all teams to be understanding and reasonable of one another during technical pauses. Any team(s) found abusing the technical pause system will be subject to suspension and/or forfeiture of the match.</p>
          
          <p>If a team is having tournament server issues for whatever reason, please send a message in NACCS Discord’s support channel named #League-Support. A NACCS or Faceit Admin will assist you with your issue.</p>

          <u>Submitting Match Results</u>
          <p>All match results are collected by FACEIT upon their completion. Only contact us if you find a discrepancy in results.</p>

          <u>Match Demos</u>
